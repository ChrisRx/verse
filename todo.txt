- Better error message for checking polymorphic function arg types
- Improve TypeInfo and related types -- allow types (int, u8, string) to be used
  as identifiers? i.e.:
    t := #typeof(x);
    if t == int {
        // ...
    }
- "unwise" cast to silence compiler error
- Packages
  - Global vars in different packages may be referred to prior to initialization!
    Decide whether this is okay, and possibly change the order that init code is
    generated in (i.e. most nested import first?)
  - Error reporting on imported package
- Defer (duh-fer)
- Methods
  - "impl" blocks
  - "static" struct (/type) methods

Things to fix:
  - Use on polymorphic types? Should this be allowed? It is weird.
  - Polydef in params of argument type does not carry the definition of "T" to the return value type?
