TODO
====

- Better error message for checking polymorphic function arg types
- Parameterized struct types
- Packages
  - Global vars in different packages may be referred to prior to initialization!
    Decide whether this is okay, and possibly change the order that init code is
    generated in (i.e. most nested import first?)
