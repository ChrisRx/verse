TODO
====

- Better error message for checking polymorphic function arg types
- Improve TypeInfo and related types -- allow types (int, u8, string) to be used
  as identifiers? i.e.:
    t := #typeof(x);
    if t == int {
        // ...
    }
- Parameterized struct types
  - Generic functions calls are not generating the right code after the first (when argument type is params with polydef in it)
- "unwise" cast to silence compiler error
- Packages
  - Global vars in different packages may be referred to prior to initialization!
    Decide whether this is okay, and possibly change the order that init code is
    generated in (i.e. most nested import first?)
  - Error reporting on imported package
