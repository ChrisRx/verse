TODO
====

- Reorganize files, factor out type-checking functions
- Better error message for checking polymorphic function arg types
- Parameterized struct types
- Packages
  - Create namespace/package structures
  - Add behavior for :: to do lookups in namespaces
  - Change #import behavior
    - Import should create an identifier as a package "alias", i.e.:
      #import "pkg/a/b" would bind the identifier "b" to refer to the package
      "pkg/a/b" in the current scope (just make sure that the packages are uniquely
      identified by the path to them within a compiler run)
